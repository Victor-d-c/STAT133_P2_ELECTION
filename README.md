# STAT133_P2_ELECTION

ABOUT THE ELECTION RESULTS IN 2008
I converted the excel file of 2008 election results into csv via a website. (http://www.zamzar.com)
I haven't figured out a more efficient way to make this change by R code. 
So before running the RMD file, please download the csv file and change the Working Directory( you can access from "Session" in Rstudio) to the path you store the csv file.
